## Price Elasticity of Demand

A coefficient that represents the relationship between a chance in price and any consequential change in demand. 

Expressed as:
$$
E = \frac{ΔQ}{ΔP} 
$$

## Cross Price Elasticity of Demand

Similar to price elasticity of demand, but represents the change in quantity of an alternative or substitute product as a consequence of change in price of another. 

Expressed as

$$
E_{xy} = \frac{ΔQx} {ΔPy} \times \frac{Py} {Qx}
$$

For example, an increased price in my product portfolio might result in my customer choosing to buy a competitor product, or a slightly cheaper product of my own (cannibalisation).
