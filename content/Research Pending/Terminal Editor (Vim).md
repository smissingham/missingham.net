I've been wondering a lot lately whether I should consider making the investment in learning vim (or neovim).
This document is going to become a place where I can jot my thoughts on this subject as I have them.


| Pros                       | Cons                                         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Remote development via SSH | Significant learning curve / time investment |
|                            |                                              |
