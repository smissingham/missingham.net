I'll aim to keep this up to date ongoing, a list where I itemise the critical tools I use for managing my digital existence.
I will only add things here once that have matured in my workflow enough that I will likely not change them out for many years.

- ### General Productivity
	- [Floorp Web Browser](https://floorp.app/en)
		- Super fast, privacy focused Mozilla Firefox fork
	- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
		- Extensible digital notes, that can't be held hostage
- ### Digital Identity
	- [Proton](https://proton.me/) (Email, VPN, Passwords)
		- Encrypted, privacy-respecting email provider
	- [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/)
		- Physical 2FA device for the super important stuff
	- [Filen](https://filen.io/) Encrypted File Sync 
		- Has an excellent native client for linux
- ### Software Development
