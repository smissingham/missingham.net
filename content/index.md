G'day, welcome to my *[Digital Garden](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/philosophy)*, where I keep my notes on thoughts, experiments, and how-to's.

I love to build & experiment with new technologies, applying my passion for software wherever I can.

My professional experience revolves primarily around revenue management,  so you'll find my notes to be a mix of revenue related software engineering & data analysis topics. 

Got an idea for a subject I should investigate? Reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-missingham/) or [Email Me](mailto:sean@missingham.net)
